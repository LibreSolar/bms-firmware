After reset, the Flash memory is protected against unwanted write or erase operations. The 
FLASH_CR register is not accessible in write mode, except for the OBL_LAUNCH bit, used 
to reload the option bits. An unlocking sequence should be written to the FLASH_KEYR 
register to open the access to the FLASH_CR register. This sequence consists of two write 
operations:
• Write KEY1 = 0x45670123
• Write KEY2 = 0xCDEF89AB
Any wrong sequence locks up the FLASH_CR register until the next reset.
In the case of a wrong key sequence, a bus error is detected and a Hard Fault interrupt is 
generated. This is done after the first write cycle if KEY1 does not match, or during the 
second write cycle if KEY1 has been correctly written but KEY2 does not match.
The FLASH_CR register can be locked again by user software by writing the LOCK bit in the 
FLASH_CR register to 1.



Or: 
1. Unlock flash (LOCK bit is reset) � it will only be reset by hardware itself upon writing two keys to the FLASH_KEYR.
 

2. Unlock option bytes (OPTWRE is set) - it will only be reset by hardware itself upon writing two keys to the FLASH_OPTKEYR.
 

� wait until flash is ready
 

3. Erase option bytes by setting OPTER bit and after that STRT bit
 

� wait until flash is ready
 

4. After the erasure is complete, reset the OPTER bit
 

5. Set the OPTPG bit to allow programming option bytes
 

6. Write the data (half word) to the desired address
 

� wait until flash is ready
 

7. Reset the OPTPG bit to complete/close programming option bytes
 

8. Launch/Apply the Option bytes (OBL_LAUNCH bit is set-system reset will be performed after this) � This step can be skipped as the option bytes will automatically load upon next reset.
 

9. Lock option bytes (OPTWRE is reset)
 

10. Lock the Flash (LOCK bit is set)
 

A more or less pseudo code is as follows:

1. 

 if((READ_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_LOCK)) != RESET)

  {

    /* Authorize the FLASH Registers access */

    WRITE_REG(FLASH->KEYR, FLASH_KEY1);

    WRITE_REG(FLASH->KEYR, FLASH_KEY2);

  }

2.

if((READ_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_OPTWRE)) == RESET)

  {

    /* Authorizes the Option Byte register programming */

    WRITE_REG(FLASH->OPTKEYR, FLASH_OPTKEY1);

    WRITE_REG(FLASH->OPTKEYR, FLASH_OPTKEY2);

  }

3.

FLASH->CR |= FLASH_CR_OPTER;

            FLASH->CR |= FLASH_CR_STRT;

4.

                FLASH->CR &= ~FLASH_CR_OPTER;

5.

                SET_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_OPTPG);

6.

                WRITE_REG(OB->RDP, ReadProtectLevel);

                Or

                *(__IO uint16_t*)Address = Data;

7.

                CLEAR_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_OPTPG);

8.

                SET_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_OBL_LAUNCH);

9.

                CLEAR_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_OPTWRE);

10.

                SET_BIT(FLASH->CR, FLASH_CR_LOCK);
