/* File '6X8.FV' as include
The font was generated with EA FontEditor. Please contact ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY
for more details (techik@lcd-module.de)

File based on official EA Arduino library.

 the array starts with a 8 byte header:
  1st Byte: 'F' first 2 bytes are always FV
  2nd Byte: 'V' for FONT VERTICAL
  3rd Byte: First code to define
  4th Byte: Last  code to define
  5th Byte: Width of character in dots
  6th Byte: Height of character in dots
  7th Byte: Height of character in bytes
  8th Byte: Bytes needed for each character (1..255)
            or 0 for big fonts calculate WidthInDots * HeightInBytes
  After that font data will follow */
